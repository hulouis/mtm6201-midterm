            <p>My name is Hu Rongxin, from Asia, I am an interactive media major student, as an international student of
                Algonquin. I feel the people here are very warm and friendly. I enjoy the study atmosphere here very
                much, and I also love my major very much. Aspire to succeed in this major.</p>

                <p>In particular, web developement, which I found very interesting. There are many interesting parts, with
                cutting-edge knowledge, I hope to be able to master it completely. And put it into practice. Although
                there are some difficulties at present. I believe I will conquer it in the near future!
